## B: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](https://github.com/dannyradden/APICurious)**
I wasnt able to completely finish APIcurious, but I feel I learned a lot from what I did complete.


## C: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**

[Github](https://github.com/somedayrainbows/ralesengine)

I really enjoyed working with Erin on this project. It went well and I learned a lot about building an API.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/glassjoseph/grab_bag)**

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://github.com/stovermc/grab_bag)**

Overall I am super satisfied with the way this project came out. I ended up staying on the same project for both sprints. It was interesting having new team members the second sprint and trying to explain the code to them.

## D: Professional Skills

#### **Professional Development Workshops**
> [Resume, Turing Portfolio, Flower, Trello, Mod-4-Plan](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1701-b/danny_radden.md)

#### **Gear Ups**

> [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

Overall the class on microagressions was pretty interesting. Before this gear-up I wasn't even familiar with the term. I think it helped to make more more self aware of what I am saying to people.

> [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

Tragedy of the commons was also an interesting thing to think about, especially in the reference framed for us. I tried to think about different ways to avoid the problem of segregated communities and workplaces. It is a hard problem to solve. I think actively seeking diversity in companies is a good start to the problem. This is one of the the things I like about Turing.

> [Choose your own adventure](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/)

I was sick during this gear up and was unable to attend :(


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
I helped to lead a few Friday spikes with my posse. The spikes focused on Technical interview prep.

#### **Posse**
I co-lead the Wozniak posse again this mod.

#### **Playing a Part**
I paired with lower mod students to help them out a few times.
